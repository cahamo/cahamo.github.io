<h3>Online Presence</h3>

<p>Other than this site, there's also the associated <a href="https://cahamo.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/cahamo">GitHub</a> repository.</p>

<p>I've got various other hobbies and interests, some of which have an online presence. Here's some:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For years I've been keen on the Pascal programming language and I've programmed mainly in the Delphi environment. Since 2002 I've run the <a href="https://delphidabbler.com">DelphiDabbler.com</a> webiste. Sad to say I don't do as much with this is I used to. Other than the website there's also:
        <ul>

            <li>DelphiDabbler repositories of <a href="https://github.com/delphidabbler">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/delphidabbler/profile/">SourceForge</a></li>
            <li>The DelphiDabbler <a href="https://twitter.com/delphidabbler">Twitter</a> feed</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I'm an amateur guitar player and electronic music composer / producer, going under the pseudonyms <em>Alo Phogg</em> and <em>Phoggy Man</em>. There's various examples of my output online:
        <ul>

            <li>My <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alo.phogg.music">Alo Phogg Music</a> Facebook page</li>
            <li>And finally, my Alo Phogg <a href="https://twitter.com/AloPhogg">Twitter</a> feed</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Why &ldquo;Cahamo&rdquo;?</h3>

<p>I'm not a very practical man - a bit cack handed you may say. I also do scenic modelling - creating dioramas. Well <i>Cahamo</i> is a contraction of <i><b>Ca</b>ck <b>Ha</b>nded <b>Mo</b>deller</i>.</p>

<p>Yeah, really.</p>
