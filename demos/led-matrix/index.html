<h1>LED Matrix Demo</h1>

<p>This project demonstrates how to use a 32&times;8 LED matrix display. The display comprises four connected 8&times;8 panels, each of which is powered by a MAX7219 chip:</p>

<p>The matrix is controlled via an SPI interface. It has the following pins: CLK, CS, DIN, GND &amp; VCC. 5V is required to operate the matrix. In this demo an Arduino Uno clone is used to control the matrix. A separate power supply is used to power the matrix to avoid overloading the Uno's built in power source.</p>

<p>A breadboard was used to connect the Uno to the LED matrix as shown below:</p>

<p>Power from my bench power supply comes from the left and is connected to the breadboard via crocodile clips. A second pair of smaller crocodile clips connects the power to the LED matrix. Note the electrolytic capacitor across the power rails to smooth the power. I think the capacitor should be between 470&mu;F and 1000&mu;F.</p>

<p>The Uno is powered via its USB connection:</p>

            <td>11 (SPI COPI)</td>
            <td>LED matrix DIN pin.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>LED matrix CLK pin.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Additionally, the matrix's VCC pin is connected to the breadboard's 5V rail.</p>

<p>The demo source code is available from the <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/demo-projects/tree/main"><code>cahamo/demo-projects</code></a> repository on GitHub. The relevant code will be found in the <code>max7219-led-matrix--uno</code> directory. All the C++ code is in <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/demo-projects/blob/main/max7219-led-matrix--uno/src/main.cpp"><code>max7219-led-matrix--uno/src/main.cpp</code></a>.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    This demo is a PlatformIO project for use with Visual Studio Code. It can be modified for use with the Arduino IDE simply by copying the code from <code>max7219-led-matrix--uno/src/main.cpp</code> into a new, blank Arduino API project and ensure that the <code>MD_MAX72XX</code> and <code>MD_Parola</code> libraries by <a href="https://github.com/MajicDesigns">MajicDesigns</a> are installed.</p>
</p>

<p>Once the code is compiled and uploaded to the Uno and the external power supply is switched on you should see the text <code>&lt;Hello&gt;</code> begin to scroll quickly down the display before pausing a while and then scrolling again. You can see the demo running in the following video.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a video of the demo in action:</p>
