<h1>Diorama: Central Control <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<p>The Central Control system co-ordinates the other parts of the diorama's electronic system.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Interpret and implement commands from the infra-red controller.</li>
    <li>Control and co-ordinate the model lighting, mechanical features and ambient lighting sub-systems.</li>
    <li>Manage any programmed sequence of events on the diorama.</li>
    <li>Manage communication between microcontrollers.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>Progress to date is limited to beginning work on requirement #4, managing communication between microcontrolers. So far experiments have been conducted into the best method of enabling the infra-red command microcontroller to communicate with the central microcontroller.</p>

<p>Two experiments have been carried out to investigate the suitability of serial communication and the use of the I&sup2;C protocol. They are:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="./experiment-4">Experiment #4: Inter-Microcontroller Serial Communication</a></li>
    <li><a href="./experiment-5">Experiment #5: Inter-Microcontroller I&sup2;C Communication</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I&sup2;C has been settled upon as the communication protocol to be used.</p>
