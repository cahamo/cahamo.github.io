<h1><em>Transfer Sidings</em> Diorama <span class="badge badge-warning">In progress</span></h1>

<p>This diorama represents a pair of transfer sidings between a narrow gauge quarry line and a standard gauge line. It is set somewhere in Great Britain in the late 1960s or early 1970s.</p>

    <p class="alert alert-warning">The diorama is currently under construction, so details may change.</p>

<p>The exchange sidings are located at the front of a small baseboard that was constructed on stretched artists' canvas that I came across for free. There is a road overbridge at the left hand side that spans a standard gauge siding. The narrow gauge siding enters from the right hand side with the entry being screened by a workshop building. A low relief small factory and a warehouse, along with a small shed in full relief,are located at the rear of the model. These buildings are separated from the exchange sidings by a yard.</p>

<p>So far three buildings have been constructed. Each of these have LEDs fitted. They are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 story low relief warehouse. This has four separate rooms, each of which has a warm white 3mm LED set in its ceiling.</li>
    <li>Small single story low relief factory. This has four bays, three of which have windows. The three bays with windows each of which have a 3mm warm white LED set in the roof space.</li>
    <li>Full relief workshop. This comprises a single room which has two warm white 3mm LEDs set in the roof timbers. There is also a forge which is designed to accommodate a 3mm red LED and a flickering 3mm amber LED to represent a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has not yet been decided whether to include LEDs in the full relief shed.</p>

<p>Each LED has wires connected to both its cathode and anode that are brought out either below the building or through the backscene.</p>

<p>It is intended to be able to switch the lighting on and off for each building separately. However no circuitry has as yet been designed (although it is likely to be very simple!).</p>
