<h1>Welcome makers</h1>

<p>This site represents one man's voyage of discovery into the world of electronics and micro-controllers.</p>

<p>I'm very new to this game - I only started in April 2021, so if you've come here in the hope of expert advice, it's time to click away now.</p>

<p>If you're learning too, stick around and learn from my mistakes!</p>

<h2>My First Project</h2>

<p>After a period of online research and ploughing through the (badly written) examples from the <em>Elegoo Uno R3 Basic Starter Kit</em> I was itching to get going. What I came up with for my first project was the <strong><a href="/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The what? An electronic version of a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_tongue_drum" title="aka tank drum or hank drum">steel tongue drum</a> is what.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/cahamo">GitHub</a> account associated with this site (no surprise if you notice the web address). It's where I keep the source code for my projects.</p>

<p>I'll be using open source license for everything.</p>
