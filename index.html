<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>This site represents one man's voyage of discovery into the world of electronics and micro-controllers.</p>

<p>I'm very new to this game: I only started in April 2021. So if you've come here in the hope of expert advice, it's time to click away now!</p>

<p>But, if you're learning too, stick around and learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p>Oh, and this is only one of numerous <a href="/about#hobbies">hobbies and interests</a> of mine, so progress is usually sporadic - I do what takes my fancy each day. It's one of the many joys of retirement.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>You can get to all my projects from the <em>Projects</em> menu, surprisingly enough.</p>

<h3>Electro-tongue drum</h3>

<p>After a period of online research and ploughing through the (badly written) examples from the <em>Elegoo Uno R3 Basic Starter Kit</em> I was itching to get going. What I came up with for my first project was the <strong><a href="/projects/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The what? An electronic version of a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_tongue_drum" title="aka tank drum or hank drum">steel tongue drum</a> is what.</p>

<p>This is a complex project for a beginner like me, so progress is slo...w. After a while it dawned on me I needed to cut my teeth on some simpler projects first. See below&hellip;</p>

<h3>Automating & lighting a diorama</h3>

<p>It was thinking about lighting a diorama I am building that got me interested in electronics in the first place, so it's no surprise that I decided to over-complicate things and automate the diorama. And so was born the <strong><a href="/projects/diorama">Diorama Electronics</a></strong> project.</p>

<h3>More to come...</h3>

<p>I've got several more projects <a href="/pipeline.html">under consideration</a>, some of which my even see the light of day!</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>As I've been plodding along I've come across some components that I've found difficult to find adequate information about - at least information I can understand. So I decided to share some of the information I've managed to pull together in case its of interest to others. Check out the <em>Resources</em> menu for more info.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/cahamo">GitHub</a> account associated with this site. It's where I keep the source code for my projects.</p>

<p>I'll be using open source license for everything.</p>
