<h2>Welcome makers</h2>

<p>This site represents one man's voyage of discovery into the world of electronics and micro-controllers.</p>

<p>I'm very new to this game - I only started in April 2021, so if you've come here in the hope of expert advice, it's time to click away now.</p>

<p>If you're learning too, stick around and learn from my mistakes!</p>

<h2>What's cooking?</h2>

<p>After a period of online research and ploughing through the (badly written) examples from the <em>Elegoo Uno R3 Basic Starter Kit</em> I was itching to get going. What I came up with for my first project was the ...</p>

<h3>Electro Tongue Drum</h3>

<p>The what? An electronic version of a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_tongue_drum" title="aka tank drum or hank drum">steel tongue drum</a> is what.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>One of the projects that atttracted me when browsing around was the <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Ismail_San/paper-piano-with-arduino-e27da7">paper piano</a>: a little keyboard that's operated by tapping on &quot;keys&quot; drawn on paper and filled in with pencil &quot;lead&quot;. The concept of detecting a finger by just touching a graphite pad intrigued me.</p>

<p>Now it's a little known fact that I'm an amateur composer and producer of <a href="https://phoggyman.bandcamp.com/">electronic music</a>, so a musical project appealed. For a while I've been interested in tongue drums. A decent one is a bit pricey for something I'd probably only play rarely, so ... you know what's coming ... let's make an electronic version of a tongue drum, with touch sensitive keys.</p>

<p>It's decided then. My first project is going to be the <b><i>Electro Tongue Drum</i></b>. I reckon it's going to take a while, so please check back for updates.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/cahamo">GitHub</a> account associated with this site (no surprise if you notice the web address). It's where I keep the source code for my projects.</p>

<p>I'll be using open source license for everything.</p>

<p>There are more that I can't recall just now, so sorry if I missed yours.</p>

<h2>Cahamo?</h2>

<p>I'm not a very practical man - a bit cack handed you may say. I also do scenic modelling - creating dioramas. Well <i>Cahamo</i> is a contraction of <i><b>Ca</b>ck <b>Ha</b>nded <b>Mo</b>deller</i>. Yeah, really.</p>
