<h1>Projects In The Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Theremin</h2>

<p>At present there's only one project that I'm considering and that's a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a> musical instrument.</p>

<p>My blog post &ldquo;<a href="https://cahamo.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-sort-of-theremin-another-project.html">A Sort-Of-Theremin - Another Project?</a>&rdquo; explains the rationale.</p>

<p>Whether this goes ahead depends on how well the <a href="/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a> project comes along.</p>
