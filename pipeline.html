<h1>Projects In The Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Theremin</h2>

<p>The first project that I'm considering is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a> musical instrument.</p>

<p>My blog post &ldquo;<a href="https://cahamo.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-sort-of-theremin-another-project.html">A Sort-Of-Theremin - Another Project?</a>&rdquo; explains the rationale.</p>

<p>This is a long term aspiration - whether it goes ahead depends on how well the <a href="/projects/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a> project comes along.</p>

<h2>Portable temperature, pressure &amp; humidity gauge</h2>

<p>We don't have a household thermometer, but could do with one. Other than on our dehumidifier, we  don't have a humidity gauge. But due to our high humidity, we need one. We don't have a baramoter but it would be interesting to have one.</p>

<p>I'm thinking it would be interesting to kill three birds with one stone and build my own portable, combined device.</p>

<p>I've got some components in stock to build this thing: a temperature / humidity sensor, a pressure sensor, an OLED display and a Raspberry Pi Pico. I just need to find a case.</p>

<h2>Fancy clock</h2>

<p>There's a really nice neopixel based clock on Instructables.com named &ldquo;<a href="https://www.instructables.com/LEDura-Analog-LED-Clock/">LEDura - Analog LED Clock</a>&rdquo;. It uses two neopixel rings: a large one that displays minutes and a smaller one for the hours.</p>

<p>I would like to build something similar but with some additional features, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A better way to update / correct the time.</li>
    <li>Possible infra red control of the clock's features.</li>
    <li>Use motion detection to switch on the clock display.</li>
    <li>Use an internet connection to set the clock using a time server.</li>
    <li>Display the times of the next local low and high tides on request. Pretty specific I know, but useful for me! This will need an internet connection too.</li>
    <li>Display temperature (and maybe humidity) on request. Yeah, I know I seem obsessed with this!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dunno how many of those ideas will make it into the final build.</p>

<p>A WiFi enabled ESP32 is the microcontroller of choice for this project.</p>

<h2>Washing line rain sensor</h2>

<p>As I mentioned already, we get quite a lot of rain. We regularly fail to notice the start of yet another shower and have dart out into the back garden to grab washing from the line.</p>

<p>So, how about a rain sensor that we can switch on whenever we put washing out? It should sound an alarm and/or send us texts when rain is detected.</p>

<p>Of course there's a risk that we'll either forget to turn it on when we put washing out or forget to turn it off afterwards. Is there a way, I wonder, of detecting washing being hung on the line and removed later?</p>

<h2>Touch screen DAW controller</h2>

<p>I've often fancied buying a touch screen controller for my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), like the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck">Elgato Stream Deck</a>, but have never got round to it. I'm not sure I can justify the cost.</p>

<p>The idea behind these things is that icons are displayed on a touch screen that control commonly used actions in the DAW. The shortcuts are customisable to suit your own workflow.</p>

<p>Having recently purchased a TFT touchscreen from AliExpress, it struck me that I could probably make one myself based around the touch screen, driven by a suitable microcontroller. The microcontroller would act as a HID Keyboard over USB or bluetooth. It would just be a matter of getting the MCU to emit the appropriate keyboard shortcuts when certain icons were pressed. Did I just say &quot;just&quot;â€½</p>
