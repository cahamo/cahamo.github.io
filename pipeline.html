<h1>Projects In The Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Theremin</h2>

<p>The first project that I'm considering is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a> musical instrument.</p>

<p>My blog post &ldquo;<a href="https://cahamo.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-sort-of-theremin-another-project.html">A Sort-Of-Theremin - Another Project?</a>&rdquo; explains the rationale.</p>

<p>This is a long term aspiration - whether it goes ahead depends on how well the <a href="/projects/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a> project comes along.</p>

<h2>Guitar Case Humidity Sensors</h2>

<p>I live close to the Irish Sea in West Wales. Even for Britain, where rain is never far away, this place is damp! As a result I have a problem with humidity affecting the sound boards of my better quality acoustic guitars. Two of them have warped. Consequently I keep them in their hard cases along with some de-humidifying sachets (made of coconut husks, I think).</p>

<p> It would be useful to find out how well the dehumidification is working and when the sachets need drying out or replacing. Of course, opening the case to measure the humidity is a non starter because once the case is open the humid outside air enters the case.</p>

<p>Therefore I have in mind a project to build humidity sensors into the guitar cases that can send data via ports in the cases to an external measuring device. There are two problems to solve:</p>

<ol>
    <li>How to fit sensors and data ports into the cases without damaging the instruments or allowing ingress of air.</li>
    <li>How to construct a device that can be plugged into the cases to read and display the humidity data.</li>
</ol>

<p>This project is strictly at the &ldquo;thinking about it&rdquo; stage! So far I've worked out that problem 1 is harder than problem 2!</p>

<h2>Portable temperature, pressure &amp; humidity gauge</h2>

<p>We don't have a household thermometer, but could do with one. Other than on our dehumidifier, we  don't have a humidity gauge. But due to our high humidity, we need one. We don't have a baramoter but it would be interesting to have one.</p>

<p>I'm thinking it would be interesting to kill three birds with one stone and build my own portable, combined device.</p>

<p>I've got some components in stock to build this thing: a temperature / humidity sensor, a pressure sensor, a 4 digit LED segment display and a Raspberry Pi Pico. I just need to find a case. So hopefully I can build it quite quickly.</p>

<h2>Fancy clock</h2>

<p>There's a really nice neopixel based clock on Instructables.com named &ldquo;<a href="https://www.instructables.com/LEDura-Analog-LED-Clock/">LEDura - Analog LED Clock</a>&rdquo;. It uses two neopixel rings: a large one that displays minutes and a smaller one for the hours.</p>

<p>I would like to build something similar but with some additional features, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A better way to update / correct the time.</li>
    <li>Possible infra red control of the clock's features.</li>
    <li>Use motion detection to switch on the clock display.</li>
    <li>Use an internet connection to set the clock using a time server.</li>
    <li>Display the times of the next local low and high tides on request. Pretty specific I know, but useful for me! This will need an internet connection too.</li>
    <li>Display temperature (and maybe humidity) on request. Yeah, I know I seem obsessed with this!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dunno how many of those ideas will make it into the final build.</p>

<h2>Gate open sensor</h2>

<p>Every morning, before letting our dog out in the back garden, my wife or I go outside to check our garden gates are bolted properly. Apart from frequently getting cold and wet, we're also concerned about the increase in dog theft and so want to know if anyone opens the gates.</p>

<p>The solution for one gate is simply to lock it. We can't do that with the other because some trade people need access. So I've a project in mind to do two things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Display an indicator, visible from inside the house, that indicates whether the gate is open or closed.</li>
    <li>Sound an alarm when the gate is opened, with an override for when we are using it or want to leave it open.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm planning to use a magnet and a reed switch to detect gate opening along with a hidden override switch.</p>

<p>As ever though, who knows how this will work out!</p>

<h2>Washing line rain sensor</h2>

<p>As I mentioned already, we get quite a lot of rain. We regularly fail to notice the start of yet another shower and have dart out into the back garden to grab washing from the line.</p>

<p>So, how about a rain sensor that we can switch on whenever we put washing out? It should sound an alarm and/or send us texts when rain is detected.</p>

<p>Of course there's a risk that we'll either forget to turn it on when we put washing out or forget to turn it off afterwards. Is there a way, I wonder, of detecting washing being hung on the line and removed later? That'll be a challenge to work on!</p>
