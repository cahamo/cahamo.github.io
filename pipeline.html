<h1>Projects In The Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Theremin</h2>

<p>The first project that I'm considering is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a> musical instrument.</p>

<p>My blog post &ldquo;<a href="https://cahamo.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-sort-of-theremin-another-project.html">A Sort-Of-Theremin - Another Project?</a>&rdquo; explains the rationale.</p>

<p>This is a long term aspiration - whether it goes ahead depends on how well the <a href="/tongue-drum">Electro Tongue Drum</a> project comes along.</p>

<h2>Guitar Case Humidity Sensors</h2>

<p>I live close to the Irish Sea in West Wales. Even for Britain, where rain is never far away, this place is damp! As a result I have a problem with humidity affecting the sound boards of my better quality acoustic guitars. Two of them have warped. Consequently I keep them in their hard cases along with some de-humidifying sachets (made of coconut husks, I think).</p>

<p> It would be useful to find out how well the dehumidification is working and when the sachets need drying out or replacing. Of course, opening the case to measure the humidity is a non starter because once the case is open the humid outside air enters the case.</p>

<p>Therefore I have in mind a project to build humidity sensors into the guitar cases that can send data via ports in the cases to an external measuring device. There are two problems to solve:</p>

<ol>
    <li>How to fit sensors and data ports into the cases without damaging the instruments or allowing ingress of air.</li>
    <li>How to construct a device that can be plugged into the cases to read and display the humidity data.</li>
</ol>

<p>This project is strictly at the &ldquo;thinking about it&rdquo; stage! So far I've worked out that problem 1 is harder than problem 2!</p>
