<h1>Diorama: Model Lighting <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<p>Six buildings are planned for the diorama, five of which will be lit.</p>

<p>LEDs will be used for all lighting. Building lights will be emulated using 3mm white LEDs. Open fires and a forge will be emulated using flickering 3mm amber LEDs. So as not to stress the microcontroller's power limits, LEDs will be switched via transistors.</p>

<p>Here are details of the buildings, the number of LEDs required and the progress with construction.</p>

            <td>This building was modified from a card kit. While construction of the building is still not quite completed, all LEDs and wiring are in place. So, for the purposes of this project, the building can be regarded as finished. It has 2 &times; 3mm white LEDs and a 3mm amber flicker LED inserted in a fireplace. The lighting LEDs are connected to magnet wire that passes down inside an internal wall and through the building's floor. The flicker LED is inserted up through a hole in the building floor. Under the floor the flicker LED's leads are soldered to single core wires. These wires and the magent wires are soldered to a piece of perfboard, with all the cathode connections commoned. Four multi-strand 7/22 cables are routed from a choc block beneath the baseboard through some trunking under the scenery, ready for passing through a hole in the foundation of the shed and soldering to the perfboard.</td>

There is to be a scratchbuilt forge with an associated chimney, that will be lit with a 3mm amber flicker LED. The three LEDs already fitted and connected to magent wire that is planned to be routed through the building floor in three different locations.</td>

The building is complete apart from weathering and connecting the wires to the relevant circuits, but can be considered as complete for the purposes of this project.</td>

The four wires are coated in heat shrink and will be passed through a hole drilled in the baseboard to a connection beneath.

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The lights are so numerous that some form of multiplexing will be required.</p>

<p>Wires from each building's LEDs will be passed through the diorama's baseboard and from there connected to the relevant circuits. No such circuits have yet been built.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>An <a href="./experiment-3.html">experiment</a> has been conducted to try to find the optimum method to use to multiplex the LEDs.</p>
