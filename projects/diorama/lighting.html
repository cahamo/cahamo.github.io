<h1>Diorama: Model Lighting <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<p>Five buildings are planned for the diorama, all of which will be lit.</p>

<p>LEDs will be used for all lighting. Building lights will be emulated using 3mm white LEDs. Open fires and a forge will be emulated using flickering 3mm amber LEDs. So as not to stress the microcontroller's power limits, LEDs will be switched via transistors.</p>

<p>Here are details of the buildings, the number of LEDs required and the progress with construction.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The lights are so numerous that some form of multiplexing will be required.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>An <a href="./experiment-3.html">experiment</a> has been conducted to try to find the optimum method to use to multiplex the LEDs.</p>
