<h1>Diorama: Model Lighting <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<p>Six buildings are planned for the diorama, five of which will be lit.</p>

<p>LEDs will be used for all lighting. Building lights will be emulated using 3mm white LEDs. Open fires and a forge will be emulated using flickering 3mm amber LEDs. So as not to stress the microcontroller's power limits, LEDs will be switched via transistors.</p>

<p>Here are details of the buildings, the number of LEDs required and the progress with construction.</p>

                <p class="mb-1 mt-0">One bay is open at the front while the other is enclosed. Each bay has a white LED for lighting. The enclosed partition has a flicker LED inserted in a fireplace.</p>
                <p class="mb-1 mt-0">The lighting LEDs are connected to coated copper wire that runs down inside an internal wall and through the building's floor. The flicker LED is inserted up through a hole in the building floor. Under the floor the flicker LED's leads are soldered to single core wires. These wires and the coated wires from the lighting LEDs are soldered to a piece of perfboard, with all the cathode connections commoned.</p>
                <p class="mb-0 mt-0">Four multi-strand 7/22 cables are routed from a choc block beneath the baseboard through some trunking under the scenery, ready for passing through a hole in the foundation of the shed and soldering to the perfboard when the building is finally fastened in place.</p>

                <p class="mb-1 mt-0">There is a rear lean-to that has been fitted with 2 &times; white LEDs, each in a different room. An office within the main building has a single white LED. The main structure will be lit with 2 &times; white LEDs that will switch on and off together. The forge will be lit with a flicker LED.</p>
                <p class="mb-0 mt-0">The three LEDs already fitted are connected to coated copper wire that is planned to be routed through the building floor in three different locations.</p>

                <p class="mb-1 mt-0">Both LEDs are connected via single core wire to three copper tapes. There is one tape for each LED's anode while the third tape is connected to both cathodes. The tape exits the roof at the rear and runs down the back wall and under the building.</p> 
                <p class="mb-0 mt-0">Before the shed is fastened in place wires will be brought up through the scenery from below the building and soldered to the copper tapes.</p>

                <p class="mb-1 mt-0">All LEDs are connected to coated copper wires which are led down through a corner of the building to emerge through the floor. The four wires below the floor are enclosed in heat shrink.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The lights are so numerous that some form of multiplexing will be required.</p>

<p>Lights will be controlled from the central control microcontroller in response to input from the infra-red control sub-system.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>An <a href="./experiment-3.html">experiment</a> has been conducted to try to find the optimum method to use to multiplex the LEDs.</p>
