<h1>Experiment #2: Power supply</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Following the decision to power the diorama using 9V DC, the next step was to design a power supply with the following features:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To enable either centre positive or centre negative power supplies to be used.</li>
    <li>To have an output for a &ldquo;power-on&rdquo; LED.</li>
    <li>To have a tap making available the full voltage after rectification.</li>
    <li>To have a tap for a 5V supply to power the microcontrollers, LEDs and motors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Testing was done with both centre-positive and centre-negative 9V DC supplies.</p>

<h2>Circuit</h2>

<p>The following circuit was drawn up:</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/projects/diorama/exp-2/power-supply-schematic.png" width="1040" height="400" alt="Power supply schematic"></p>

<p>The circuit was tested on a breadboard:</p>

<p>Since the voltages obtained were as expected, a trial circuit was constructed on perf board that replicated the breadboard design. A bank of 8 pins were provided for external connection, as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 pins for 9V input - polarity agnostic.</li>
    <li>7.8V and GND pins for the power-on indicator LED (the LED is mounted above the 9V socket, not on the perf board).</li>
    <li>7.8V and GND pins made available for connection to other circuit boards.</li>
    <li>5V and GND pins made available for connection to other circuit boards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that this was my first ever soldered circuit there were some problems and the circuit wasn't as tidy as it could be!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Evaluating the soldered circuit led to a redesign of the layout of the board along with some changes in functionality. These changes were incorporated in a second version of the board. The functional changes were:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="mb-2">The LED current limiting resistor was omitted from the circuit board &ndash; it was decided to solder the resistor directly to the LED, making it easier to change the value, if necessary, at a later date.</li>
    <li class="mb-2">
        The number and layout of the output pins was changed. From left to right the pins were arranged as follows:
        <ol class="mt-2">
            <li>A pair of 9V input pins for connection to the power input socket.</li>
            <li>A pair of pins for connection to the power-on LED &ndash; these were 7.8V and GND respectively.</li>
            <li>A pair of 7.8V pins for connection to other circuit boards.</li>
            <li>A rank of five GND pins for connection with other circuit boards.</li>
            <li>A rank of three 5V pins for connection with other circuit boards.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
