<h1>Experiment #6: Infra-red receiver feedback RGB LED colour balance</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It has been decided to use a common cathode RGB LED in the infra red receiver unit to provide feedback to the user when entering commands via the infra-red controller.</p>

<p>For any given voltage, the red, green and blue elements of an RGB LED will have different brightness levels when connected to current limiting resistors of the same value. This means that any colours that require a mix of LED elements don&rsquo;t appear as expected. So it has been decided to use different value resistors for each of the elements. This experiment was to find what resistances gave the most balanced brightness level for each LED element.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>An RGB LED was tested displaying the following colours in a repeating sequence, using a pulse modulated 5V signal.</p>

<ul>
    <li>red</li>
    <li>green</li>
    <li>yellow</li>
    <li>blue</li>
    <li>white</li>
</ul>

<p>Resistors of different values were attached to each of the LED&rsquo;s red, green and blue anodes until:</p>

<ol>
    <li class="mb-2">The red, green and blue LED segments were equally bright when run at full intensity.</li>
    <li class="mb-2">White appeared with as little colour cast as possible.</li>
    <li class="mb-0">Yellow, which is a mix of red and green, appeared correctly and at a similar intensity to the red, green and blue segments on their own.</li>
</ol>

<aside>
    <p class="alert alert-info">It would have been much easier to use three potentiometers to find the required resistances, but at the time I didn't have any suitable ones in stock.</p>

<aside>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">It is important to calculate the minimum safe resistance for each of the LED&rsquo;s elements and never to use less than that resistance.</p>

<h2>Circuit</h2>

<p>The red, green and blue anodes of a common cathode RGB LED were connected to different PWM pins of an Arduino Nano clone, via resistors. The LED&rsquo;s cathode was connected to the Nano&rsquo;s GND pin.</p>

<p>The circuit diagram was as follows:</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The code used in this experiment is available from the <code><a href="https://github.com/cahamo/diorama">cahamo/diorama</a></code> project on GitHub, in the <code>research\ir-control-tests\rgb-led-colour-balance</code> directory. The code was developed in C++ using VSCode with the PlatformIO extension installed.</p>

<p>There is just one program, <code><a href="https://github.com/cahamo/diorama/blob/main/research/ir-control-tests/rgb-led-colour-balance/src/rgb-led-colour-balance.cpp">rgb-led-colour-balance.cpp</a></code> that cycles through each of the colours listed above and sends the required PWM signals to the RGB LED&rsquo;s red, green and blue anodes.</p>

<p>When the primary colours red, green and blue were tested, a &ldquo;fully on&rdquo; value of 255 was sent to the associated anode, while the others were turned off. The PWM values sent to the RGB LED for the &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; colours yellow and white were modified in the code until the colours appeared with approximately the same intensity as the primary colours.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The following resistances were found to (a) give the required overall intensity of the LED and (b) give the best balance between the red, green and blue elements:</p>

<p>The following PWM values were used in the test program to balance the intensities of each colour:</p>
