<h1>Experiment #7: Basic servo test</h1>

<p>At least some of the diorama's electo-mechanical &quot;features&quot; will be operated by servo motors. Several SG90 9G servo motors have been obtained.</p>

<p>This experiment was aimed at learning the basics of how such motors are operated using the Arduino <em>Servo</em> library and to check performance of a servo motor against expectations.</p>

<p>A simple circuit was created that used an Arduino Uno clone to control a single servo. Connections were as follows:</p>

            <th scope="col">Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>5V</td>
            <td>VCC</td>
            <td>5V Power supply</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GND</td>
            <td>GND</td>
            <td>Ground connection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>SIG</td>
            <td>PWM control signal</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Uno was programmed put the servo through its paces. It first moves the servo to pre-determined angles and then sweeps the servo's arm from its minimum to maximum angles and back again. After a pause the whole process is repeated.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    This program was developed using VSCode using the PlatformIO extension. It can be modified for use with the Arduino IDE simply by copying the code into a new, blank project. The required <em>Servo</em> library is installed in the Arduino IDE by default.</p>
</p>

<p>The program was run and the behaviour of the servo was observed and found to match the expected performance.</p>
