<h1>Day Of Week Clock</h1>

<p>My elderly mother often forgets what day it is. This means she's taking her medication on the wrong days and getting upset and confused. There's no point in getting her a complicated clock that displays the day of the week along with date, time etc. that has loads of buttons because it will confuse her and she'll never remember how to use it.</p>

<p>So I decided to try to build her a clock that only shows the day of the week.</p>

<p>Right now I've just collected together the parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 32&times;8 LED to display the date.</li>
  <li>A battery backed real time clock.</li>
  <li>An Arduino Nano clone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clock will be mains powered via USB. There's no point in makihg the clock battery powered since my mother will not remember to change or charge them.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">That's where things rest just now. I'll come back and update when there's soje progress.</p>
