<h1>Gate Open Sensor</h1>

<h2>Whys and Wherefores</h2>

<p>Every morning, before letting our dog out in the back garden, my wife or I go outside to check our garden gates are bolted properly. Apart from frequently getting cold and wet, we're also concerned about the increase in dog theft and so want to know if anyone opens the gates.</p>

<p>The solution for one gate is simply to lock it. We can't do that with the other because occasional access is needed for deliveries.</p>

<p>This project aims to solve the problem of the second gate by:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Fitting a sensor to the gate that detects it opening and closing.</li>
    <li>Displaying an indicator that indicates whether the gate is open or closed.</li>
    <li>Sounding an alarm when the gate is opened.</li>
    <li>Permitting the alarm to be disabled when we need to use the gate or leave it open.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Gate Sensor Unit</h3>

<p>My initial plan was to fit single magnetic reed switch to the gate post with a magnet on the gate immediately opposite to the switch. Thus the magnet would hold the switch closed, so that the circuit would be broken when the gate opens. This would then light the required light and sound the alarm.</p>

<p>I rejected this plan for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The detector circuit would normally be conducting electricity. I would prefer it if the circuit would normally be off.</li>
    <li>I would be relying on a single reed switch which would be a single point of failure.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a rethink I decided to leave the magnet on the gate but to mount three reed switches side by side, offset from the gate post so that the switches remain open when the gate is closed. When the gate was opened the magnet would switch on each of the reed switches in sequence as it passed them. The switches would turn off again after the magnet passed. A microcontroller would detect these switches closing and deduce the direction the gate was travelling. When the gate was closed the switches would open and close in the reverse order and again the microcontroller could deduce the direction of travel. Such a circuit would still work if only two switches activated, so there's some redundancy in the system. The three switches would be mounted inside a plastic case and a magnet strong enough to close the switches through the case would be used.</p>

<p>Here's a rough diagram of how the switch case and magnet would be mounted:</p>

<h3>Alarm Circuit</h3>

<p>It was decided to use a 555 timer IC to send a square wave to a speaker. In order to make the alarm sound more annoying an additional 555 was added that turned the alarm on and off every couple of seconds.</p>

<p>The following circuit was drawn up:</p>

<p>555 timer IC2 generates the square wave that is sent to the speaker via capacitor C5. According calculations, IC2 generates a pulse of approximately 687Hz with a duty cycle &asymp;52.4%, which is as close as I could get to 50%. This means the speaker should generate a &ldquo;musical&rdquo; note somewhere between E5 and F5.</p>

<p>Timer IC1 generates a slow pulse that turns IC3 on and off. The theoretical period of the oscillation is 1.857s, with a duty cycle of 62.687%, so that the alarm should sound for 1.164s in every cycle. In practise, of course, the actual period and duty cycle will differ from the theoretical values.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<h3>Sensor Unit &amp; Magnet</h3>

<p>The three reed switches have been mounted inside an old 3 &times; AA battery box, modified to suit. The switches were soldered to perf board then mounted hard against one side of the case and held in place with hot glue. The switches were commoned at one end and the common wire and one additional wire per switch were brought out to header pins outside the case. Each connection was duplicated inside the case to provide some redundancy in case a wire breaks. All the electrical parts were then covered in hot glue, which was also used to seal on the case lid. A block of wood on which to mount the case was screwed to the gate post and the case was drilled in three places to permit it to be screwed to the mounting block. The following montage illustrates:</p>

<p>A redundant kitchen cupboard door magnet was chosen as the magnet to be attached to the gate. It was tested and found able to switch on the reed switches at the distance that was planned to be used.</p>

<h3>Alarm</h3>

<p>The circuit shown above was constructed on two breadboards and has been tested. Here's a video of the (not very loud) alarm in action:</p>

<p>The sound generating 555 chip is on the small breadboard and the 555 that pulses the sound on and off is on the larger breadboard.</p>

<p>Testing the circuit on the breadboard revealed that the speaker produced its loudest sound at 4393Hz, much higher than the expected 687Hz. However it did produce a lower peak sound at 872Hz.</p>
