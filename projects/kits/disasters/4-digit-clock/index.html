<p>This kit, purchased from AliExpress, was supposed to produce a digital clock with an alarm buzzer. It was bought mainly for soldering practice rather than as a practical clock.</p>

<p>This build failed entirely because of my clumsiness. I didn't get the LED display seated properly on the circuit board and my cack handed attempt to desolder and reseat it resulted in delamination of the circult board. The board was damaged beyond repair.</p>

<p>I did manage recover a few parts, including the LED display. The remains languish in my parts box awaiting further desoldering.</p>
