<h1>Breathing LEDs Kit</h1>

<p>This kit is quite simple. When built it simply pulses 4 blue LEDs at a speed determined by a trim pot. Once again it was purchased from AliExprress. The following advert shows the content of the kit. The chip is an LM358 dual op-amp:</p>

<p>The kit was easy to construct and worked first time. Here's the completed kit:</p>

<p>I quite like this kit. I might use it at some point as a decoration. The only slight problem is that a 12V feed is required and I only have one suitable power supply.</p>

<p>Here's a video showing the completed kit working and the pulse speed being adjusted. Be warned that the LEDs were so bright that the auto-exposure of the phone used for filming couldn't cope.</p>
