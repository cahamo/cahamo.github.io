<h1>Fireworks LEDs Kit</h1>

<p>This kit comprises an asterisk shaped &quot;star&quot; of LEDs that light in sequence, supposedly giving an impression of a fireworks display. The speed of the sequence can be adjusted. As usual the kit came from AliExpress:</p>

<p>There were a lot of parts on this kit, most of them being red and yellow LEDs:</p>

<p>A lot of care was taken in making sure that all the LEDs were soldered in place with the correct polarity. Numerous checks were made with a multimeter to ensure that the LEDs all worked and that the solder joints were good. Even after all the checking there was just one LED that wouldn't light. A hour or so rechecking all the soldering and polarities led me to the conclusion that there was a broken track in the PCB. After a bit of track tracing I found the culprit and soldered a wire in place to circumvent the track. And voil√†, everything worked. The following photos show the kit after fixing the fault:</p>

<p>Both my wife and I actually like the appearance of the finished item. We have it on permanent display in our dining room with a glass paperweight resting on top of it, which defracts the light in a pleasing way. I adds to the atmosphere of the candlelit dinners we have most evenings in winter.</p>
    
<p>Here's a video showing the finished thing, sans paperweight, with me adjusting the speed:</p>
