<h1>Other Kits</h1>

<p>This page briefly dicusses the various kits I've built as-is, i.e. I've not modified them, except where needed to get them to work! Most of the kits came from AliExpress.</p>

    <h2>LED Spinner Kit</h2>

    <p>This is a circular PCB which has a long screw spacer through its centre at right angles to the plane of the disk. The PCB is spun about the screw axis like a top. A sprung switch closes under centrifugal force when the PCB is spun. The switch activates a circuit that turns on a line of LEDs. The LEDs are supposed to light up brightly enough to appear as concentric circles of light. See the left hand image above, taken from the advert on AliExpress advert shows how things are supposed to appear:</p>

    <p>Here's the kit as delivered and as built:</p>

    <p>The kit went together easily enough, and sort of worked. However, the LEDs were of unequal brightness. Probing around with my multimeter showed that all LEDs were operating, but some were so dim they were impossible to see without looking closely. Maybe a better choice of resistor values might improve things. The following, very short, video shows the rather disappointing result when viewed in daylight. I didn't check it out in the dark. Disappointing!</p>

    <h2>Fireworks LED Kit</h2>

    <p>This kit comprises an asterisk shaped &quot;star&quot; of LEDs that light in sequence, supposedly giving an impression of a fireworks display. The speed of the sequence can be adjusted. As usual the kit came from AliExpress:</p>

    <p>There were a lot of parts on this kit, most of them being red and yellow LEDs:</p>

    <p>A lot of care was taken with this kit in ensuring all the LEDs were wired in with the correct polarity. A lot of checks were made with a multimeter to ensure that the LEDs all worked and that the solder joints were good. Even after all the checking there was just one LED that wouldn't light. A hour or so rechecking all the soldering and polarities led me to the conclusion that there was a broken track in the PCB. After a bit of track tracing I found the culprit and soldered a wire in place to circumvent the track. And voil√†, everything worked. The following photos show the kit after fixing the fault:</p>

    <p>I actually quite like the appearance of this one - I'll possible use it at Christmas. Here's a video showing the finished thing, with me adjusting the speed:</p>
