<h1>Sound Activated LED Kit</h1>

<p>Having made a complete mess of my <a href="../../circular-led-chaser/">first attempt</a> at this kit, I bought another, determined to get it right this time. The kit has a microphone that causes a CD4017 decade counter to advance each time sound is detected. The decade counter then selects a LED to illuminate.</p>

<p>Here's how the kit is presented in the advert on AliExpress:</p>

<p>The contents of the kit are revealed in this other photo taken from the AliExpress page:</p>

<p>This time the kit went together without any problems. The only change that was made to was add a couple of right angled connectors to enable power to be connected easily. The following photo shows the completed kit, front and rear:</p>

<p>And finally, here's a video of the finished product rersponding to the sound of a tambourine being hit:</p>
