<h1>Rain Sensors: Detector <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<section id="requirements">

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>There are two requirements for the rain detector:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>An alarm is sounded when rain is detected.</li>
        <li>The alarm must have an on/off switch so we can switch it on only when needed, for example, when there is washing drying outside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>The rain detector comprises an off the shelf sensor pad containing two conductive tracks that are not connected to each other. Water falling on the plate bridges the tracks and lowers the resistance of the pad. A MH series interface module is connected to the sensor pad and produces both an analogue signal whose voltage depends on the resistance of the sensor pad and a digital signal that goes from high to low when the sensor pad resistance reaches a certain threshold value. A potentiometer is used to adjust the threshold. Both items were purchased as a single package along with a very short DuPont cable to connect them:</p>

    <p class="alert alert-warning">The output of the interface module will eventually be used to trigger an alarm. This circuitry has not yet been designed.</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <p>A housing for the rain detector was designed in TinkerCAD and printed on a Bambu Labs A1 3D printer using Amazon Basics orange PLA. The housing includes two lugs to enable the unit to be screwed to a wooden base. Brass M3 heat-set threaded inserts were fitted to each corner of the housing to permit the rain sensor to be screwed in place. A hole was included in the base of the housing so that water can escape.</p>

    <p>The following photo shows the housing after the heat-set inserts were added:</p>

        <p class="alert alert-info">The heat set inserts were pressed in place using a soldering iron with a specialised bit designed for this purpose.</p>

            alert!</strong> The first time I attempted to fit the heat set inserts I got the soldering iron much to hot and trashed the housing. The one you see here is a reprint! Be warned, you need the soldering iron to be no more than about 100&deg;C hotter than the printing temperature of the PLA. In my case that's about 310&deg;C.</p>

    <p>The rain sensor pad was attached to the housing with nylon M3 crosshead bolts:</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 3: Sensor pad fitted to housing</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>After a rethink it was decided to mount the detector at an angle to enable rain water to drain from the detector more effeciently. At first it was planned to fasten the housing to a triangular shaped piece of wood that would in turn be fastened to the level wooden base. Instead of such a piece of wood a base for the housing was designed that had a 22.5&deg; angled top. The base has two pairs of lugs, one pair to be bolted to the existing lugs on the housing with the second pair being used to fasten the base to the wooden baseboard.</p>

    <p>The base was designed in TinkerCAD and 3D printed using the same printer as above, but this time using Bambu Labs basic black PLA. The base was printed with thicker walls than the housing for extra strength. The change of PLA was only made because I'd run out of the orange PLA used for the housing.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>The base was then attached to the housing using 2 &times; M4 nuts, washers and 27mm bolts. The bolts were too long, but I had no shorter ones. They were cut down using a slitting disk mounted on a rotary tool. After the bolts were shortened the nuts were fixed in place with superglue. The housing was then blackened using black permanent marker pens. The following photos show the assembly before and after blackening.</p>

    <aside>
        <p class="alert alert-info">Reprinting the housing with an angled base was considered but rejected to avoid having to add new heat set inserts at an angle.</p>
