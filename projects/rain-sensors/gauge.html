    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The purpose of the project is to measure and record rainfall.</p>

    <p>The project requirements are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To measure the rainfall over a series of predefined periods</li>
        <li>To display the current rainfall</li>
        <li>To record each period's rainfall in a file on removable storage in a format suitable for importing into a spreadsheet</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="alert alert-warning">This page is structured as if there was an orderly, linear process from design to construction. The truth is that process was iterative, through design, construction, testing, redesign and so on. Every single 3D printed component was re-designed and re-printed at least once. I've not gone into all the gruesome details here, because that would make this page much too long and difficult to read. However, some design changes are referred to in the text where the learning point is important.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>Design Overview</h3>

    <p>This project comprises a 3D printed rain gauge coupled to a microcontroller, storage and display.</p>

    <p>The gauge collects rain and funnels it down into a pivoted bucket component, comprising two buckets with an attached magnet as shown in <em>figure 1</em>:</p>

    <figure id="fig-1">
        <p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/projects/rain-sensors/gauge/rain-sensors--gauge--bucket-model-render_400x263.png" width="400" height="263" alt="Rain gauge bucket illustration"></p>
        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 1: Illustration of the rain gauge bucket</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The two buckets are pivoted about their common centre point. The mechanism starts off angled so that one bucket is higher than the other. Rain coming in from above fills the raised bucket. When sufficient rain has gathered in the bucket it pivots and empties its contents, bringing the other bucket up under the water flow. The process then repeats.</p>

    <p>Each time the buckets pivot the magnet moves past a reed switch causing a pulse to be emitted that can be be processed by a microcontroller.</p>

    <h3>Rain Gauge Assembly</h3>

    <p>The rain gauge assembly is designed to capture and funnel rain water onto the buckets shown in <em>figure 1</em>. Renderings of the CAD designs of the components of the assembly are shown in <em>figure 2</em>:</p>

    <h3>Microcontroller</h3>

    <p>The pulses emitted from the gauge are counted by a microcontroller which calculates the amount rain that must have fallen to trigger each pulse. The total rainfall is displayed on a screen and recorded in memory. Periodically the data is stored on an SD card.</p>

    <p>The microcontroller program must be calibrated before use. The amount of rain captured by the funnel and the volume of water needed to tip the pivoted buckets is required to do this. The catchment area of the funnel can be measured. The amount of water that is required for a bucket to tip and empty must be arrived at by experiment.</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <h3>Rain Gauge</h3>

    <p>The rain gauge components described above were 3D printed on a Bambu Labs A1 3D printer using Bambu Basic black PLA. The models were sliced using the Bambu slicer using the default 0.20mm strong print profile and 0.4mm &#x2300; nozzle. The following montage shows all the printed parts. The parts are not to scale relative to each other:</p>
    
    <figure id="fig-3">

        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 3: All 3D printed components</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>A 10mm &#x2300; &times; 3mm deep neodymium magnet was glued into the magnet holder attached to the buckets. The magnet cap was then glued over the exposed part of the magnet. Superglue was used in both cases.</p>

    <figure id="fig-4">

        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 4: Magnet fitted to the magnet holder</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>A normally open, plastic bodied reed switch, 2.7mm square section &times; 14mm long, was soldered to two 20cm lengths of 7/0.2mm stranded wire. The reed switch was then mounted into the provided channel in the bucket pivot unit, securred by superglue. Heat shrink was added to protect sections of the wire. The pivot unit was bolted to its base with 2 &times; M3 nuts and 10mm hex head bolts.</p>
        
    <figure id="fig-5">

    </figure>

    <p>A 5cm long piece of round 3mm &#x2300; mild steel bar was cut to use as an axle that allows the buckets to move within the pivot unit. The axle holes in the pivot unit had to be drilled out to 3.2mm in order for the axle to fit. A M3 washer was threaded over the axle on either side of the buckets to limit side to side movement. The &quot;pimples&quot; surrounding the holes on the side of the buckets component were filed down until the bucket rotated freely on the axle with minimal side to side movement. The axle is a snug friction fit in the pivot unit meaning that the axle remains stationary while the bucket pivots on it. At this stage the wires from the reed switch were glued in place with superglue to avoid them fouling the axle.</p>

    <aside>
        <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Strange behaviour.</strong> In earlier iterations of the design of the bucket pivot mount some strange behaviour was noted if the wire connected to the top of the reed switch was bent at 90&deg; to the switch. When the magnet was located on the same side as the wire then the reed switch was held open all the time. This didn't occur with the magnet tilted in the opposite direction. I don't know what caused this, but my hypothesis is that the magnet induced a magnetic field in the wire that held the reed switch closed. Routing the wire vertically down in front of the reed switch fixed this problem.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>Once the interaction of the magnet and reed switch was proved to be working as expected the reed switch was covered in hot melt glue to protect it from the elements.</p>

    <p>The funnel plug, that gradually narrows the drain hole, was fitted into the hole at the bottom of the funnel. The plug had to be filed to fit snugly, so that its top was flush with the top of the hole in the funnel. The plug's bottom sits proud of the funnel base and fits through the hole at top of the case. Superglue was run around the joint between the funnel and plug then further filing ensured that the boundary of the funnel plug with the funnel hole was as smooth as possible. The funnel was now bolted to the top of the case using 4 &times; M5 nuts and 12mm hex head bolts.</p>

    </aside>

    <p>It was now time to assemble the whole gauge. The funnel / casing assembly, gauge assembly and mounting brackets all had their mounting bolt holes drilled out to 3.2mm &#x2300; and were then bolted together using 4 &times; M3 nuts, washers and 16mm hex head bolts. The wires from the reed switch were led out to one side.</p>

    <h2>Calibration</h2>

    <p>The gauge needs to be calibrated before being used. We need to know how much water is required to tilt a bucket. To do this we pour a measured amount of water through the gauge and count the number of times the bucket tilts. The amount of water required to tilt the bucket is the volume of water put through the gauge divided by the number of tilts counted. It is advisable to run the test several times and to use the average of all the results.</p>

    <h3>Circuit</h3>

    <p>An Arduino Nano clone was used to count the number of times the gauge's reed switch closes while pouring water. The count was displayed on a 2&times;40 character I&sup2;C LCD display. To enable several tests to be undertaken sequentially a momentary push button was used to clear the counter. <em>Figure 10</em> below shows the circuit:</p>

    <figure id="fig-10">
        <p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/projects/rain-sensors/gauge/calibration--circuit_700x280.png" width="700" height="280" alt="Calibration circuit diagram"></p>
        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 10: Calibration circuit diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>One of the wires from the rain gauge reed switch is coupled to Nano pin D6 while he other connection to the reed switch is connected to ground. Similarly, one terminal of the push switch is connected to Nano pin D2 and the other terminal is also connected to ground. Both pins D2 and D6 are configured as input pins that are pulled up to 5V internally. The I&sup2;C display is connected to 5V, ground and to Nano pins A4 and A5, which double as the Nano's SDA and SCL I&sup2;C control pins respectively. The Nano is powered by connecting 5V to its 5V pin and ground to a GND pin.</p>

    <p>The circuit was built on a breadboard as shown in <em>figure 11</em> below. The leads from the rain gauge were connected to the circuit via crocodile clips. 5V power was supplied by a breadboard power supply, connected to a 9V wall wart via a barrel jack.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center">Figure 11: Calibration circuit as built</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Software</h3>

    <p>The microcontroller program was written in C++ using VSCode and the PlatformIO extension. The code was targetted at the Arduino platform. The source code is available from the <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/rain-sensors/tree/develop/code/gauge-calibration"><code>code/gauge-calibration</code></a> directory of the <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/rain-sensors/"><strong>cahamo/rain-sensors</strong></a> project on GitHub.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>10 successful calibration tests performed. For each test a kitchen measuring jug was filled with approximately 800ml of water. This water was poured into the gauge as slowly as possible. After the jug was emptied the number of bucket tilts was read from the LCD and recorded. The count was then reset using the push switch and the experiment was repeated. The results of the tests are shown in the following table. The left column contains the number of tilts recorded per 800ml of water for each test while the right hand column shows the average number of millilitres of water required to tilt a bucket in that test, rounded to 2 decimal places:</p>

            <p class="mt-0 mb-2">There was significant variation in the test results, the standard deviation being &approx; 3.9 tilts per 800ml of water. There are several possible contributary factors to this inaccuracy:</p>
            <ol class="mt-0 mb-2">
                <li>The use of a kitchen measuring jug makes it impossible to measure exactly 800ml of water to use in each test.</li>

                <li>The speed at which water was poured was not consistent: pouring too fast may cause the bucket to tilt prematurely because of the momentum of the water.</li>
                <li>It was not possible to make allowances for the water remaining in a bucket at the end of the test: it could have been empty or almost about to tilt.</li>
