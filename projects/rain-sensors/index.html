<h1>Rain Sensors</h1>

<section id="about"></section>

    <h2>Whys and Wherefores</h2>

    <p>The original idea for this project was to design and build a rain detector that sounded an alarm to warn us of rain when we've got washing hanging out to dry.</p>

    <p>But then I watched a video by Explaining Computers that demonstrated a project to measure rainfall. That piqued my interest so I decided to build that too.</p>

    <p>I've decided to combine both items into a single project with all the sensor equipment mounted together.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>All electronics should be kept inside the house.</li>
        <li>The gauge and detector should be mounted close to each other in a location that is as unaffected by surrounding structures so that it receives the full rainfall.</li>
        <li>Both should be located as close as possible to the house to minimise the length of wiring runs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The project builds</h2>

    <p>It has been decided to locate the rain detector next to the rain gauge on the roof of our garage, which is a reasonably exposed location but also conveniently close to the house to minimise the length of external wiring.</p>

    <p>The detector and gauge will both be wired to a junction box that will be located near them both. Wiring will be run from the junction box to the house.</p>

    <p>Each sub-project has its own page, as follows:</p>

            <h3 class="mb-2">Rain Detector</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">This comprises a rain detector unit mounted outside. It is connected to a simple alarm circuit inside the house.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-2">Rain Gauge</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">This comprises a rain collector unit mounted outside. It sends data to a microcontroller inside the house that calculates the rainfall, displays it and records the rainfall per day on removable storage.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-2">Junction box</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">Since the rain detector and gauge are to be mounted together outside and both will be connected to equipment in the house, a junction box is used to connect both sensor units to wiring that runs to the house.</p>
