<h1>Rain Sensors: Junction Box <span class="badge badge-warning">In&nbsp;progress</span></h1>

<section id="intro">

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <p>The purpose of the junction box is to connect the wires coming from the rain detector and gauge units to more substantial cable that will be run into the house.</p>

</section>

<section id="build">

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <p>The junction box is to be constructed from two 3D printed components: the main housing and a lid.</p>

    <p>A terminal block is to be used to connect the wires coming from the rain detector and gauge to th more substantial cable that runs to the house.</p>

    <p>The terminal block will be mounted inside the housing. The box will then be filled with sealant and the lid glued in place.</p>

    <p>The following photo shows the 3D printed housing and lid:</p>

    <p class="alert alert-warning">That's all the progress there is to date.</p>

    <h2>STL file</h2>

    <p>An STL file that can be sliced to produce the 3D printed components can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/rain-sensors"><code>cahamo/rain-sensors</code></a> repository on GitHub.</p>
