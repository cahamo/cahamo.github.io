<h1>Using a round GC9A01 240&times;240 TFT display</h1>

<section id="introduction">

    <p>I bought this little round 240&times;240 pixel TFT display from AliExpress:</p>

    <p>All that remained to do was to figure out how to drive it using an Arduino MCU. This job was made much simply thanks to the marvellous <a href="https://dronebotworkshop.com/gc9a01/">DroneBot Workshop article</a> about how to use a similar display.</p>

<section id="pinout">

    <h2>Pinout</h2>

    <p>The display uses the SPI protocol - don't let the presence of SDA and SCL pins make you think it's IÂ²C!. From left to right the pins have the following meaning:</p>

    <table class="table table-responsive">
        <thead class="thead-light text-left">
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Pin</th>
                <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-left">
            <tr>
                <td>RST</td>
                <td>Reset</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CS</td>
                <td>SPI Chip Select</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>DC</td>
                <td>Sets the display into either Data or Command mode</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>SDA</td>
                <td>SPI COPI (Controller Out, Peripheral In) aka MOSI</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>SCL</td>
                <td>SPI Serial Clock</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GND</td>
                <td>Ground</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>VCC</td>
                <td>Power supply: 3.3V</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Note that there is no SPI Controller In, Peripheral Out (CIPO aka MISO) pin since the SPI traffic is all from the controller to the display peripheral. There also additional control pins: RST &amp; DC.</p>

    <h2>Test Circuit</h2>

    <p>The following breadboard wiring diagram shows how to connect the display to an Arduino Uno.</p>

    <p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/resources/round-tft-uno-test-circuit_960x665.png" width="960"
        height="665" alt="Round TFT display test circuit with Arduino Uno"></p>

    <p>Because the Uno is 5V and the display is 3.3V, a logic level converter is required to convert the Uno's 5V signals to 3.3V for the display. Here a <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txs0108e.pdf?ts=1712993089777">TXS0108E</a> 8 channel logic level converter is used. The &quot;A&quot; side <strong>must</strong> be used as the 3.3V side and the &quot;B&quot; side <strong>must</strong> be used as the 5V side.</p>

    <p>Here is a picture of the circuit as built and operating:</p>

<section id="source-code">

    <p>The Arduino IDE was used to compile and upload the code need to test the display.</p>

    <p>Here I simply copied the code used in the <a href="https://dronebotworkshop.com/gc9a01/">DroneBot Workshop article</a> mentioned above. There are six steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Ensure the Adafruit GC9A01A library, and all its dependencies are installed in the Arduino IDE.</p>
            <p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/resources/round-tft-display-library-install_232x387.png" width="232"
            height="387" alt="Round TFT display Arduino IDE library screen shot"></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Load the <code>graphicstest</code> example sketch from the IDE's <em>File | Examples | Adafruit GC9A01A | graphicstest</em> menu option.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Look just below the line:</p>
            <pre class="well">#else // ALL OTHER BOARDS - EDIT AS NEEDED</pre>
            <p>to locate the line:</p>
            <pre class="well">#define TFT_DC  7</pre>
            <p>and change this line to:</p>
            <pre class="well">#define TFT_DC  9</pre>
            <p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/resources/round-tft-uno-arduino-ide_500x349.png" width="500"
                height="349" alt="Round TFT display Arduino IDE source code changes"></p>
            <p>This is needed because the display's <em>DC</em> pin is attached to the Uno's pin <em>9</em>, whereas the sketch assumes pin <em>9</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Turn on the 3.3V power supply.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Connect the Uno to a USB on the computer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Compile and upload the sketch to Uno.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Adafruit demo should now run. Some of the output will be truncated because the code was written for a square display and so some of the display is off screen on the circular display.</p>
