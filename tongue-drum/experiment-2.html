<h1>Experiment #2: Tin Foil Sensor</h1>

<p><strong>** This exeriment is a work in progress **</strong></p>

<p>Some examples of metal based sensors were found online. Noticing how much more responsive the results from the CapacitiveSensor library were when the paper clip was accidentally touched suggested that metal sensors would be better. So the obvious next iteration in the design of the instrument's keys was to try a metalic sensor.</p>

<h2>Sensor</h2>

<p>For this sensor an approximately 4.7&times;7.5cm rectangle of cheap kitchen foil was used. This was attached, along it's shorter side, to a slightly larger piece of card using copper tape. The copper tape has conductive adhesive. One pin of a piece of breadboard jumper cable was soldered to the copper tape. The remaining edges of the tin foil were attached to the card using masking tape.</p>

<h2>Circuit</h2>

<p>The circuit used in <a href="./experiment-1.html">experiment 1</a> was adapted slightly for this sensor. The only change was that a 1k&ohm; resistor was placed in series with the sensor. This was done to minimise the risk to the micro-processor from any static discharge from a finger through the tin foil.</p>

<p>The circuit was as follows:</p>

<p>Once again, the Uno was supplied with 5V from the PC via it's USB port. The breadboard and other components were connected in a logically similar way to the following diagram:</p>

<p>Pin 2 of the Uno is configured as an output pin and is connected, via a 1M&ohm; resistor to input pin 3 <em>and</em> the 1k&ohm; resistor protecting the sensor.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The code used is the same as that used in <a href="./experiment-1.html">experiment 1</a>: <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/electro-tongue-drum/tree/main/src/research/SingleSensorRawDataLogger"><code>SingleSensorRawDataLogger</code></a>. This code takes repeated sensor readings using the CapacitiveSensor library and reports the results over the Uno's serial port.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>In these tests the aim was to test various sample rates and observe two different attributes of the sensor:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The difference in value of results when the sensor was touched as opposed to when it was not touched.</li>
    <li>How quickly the sensor responded to taps at different rates.</li>
</ol>

<p>The test was run multiple times, each time with the code altered to use different rates. These were 1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200 and 255. The same test rhythm was tapped out each time. This was:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A long tap, with the finger held down.</li>
    <li>The rhythm of a single verse of &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; with the finger released quickly after each tap.</li>
    <li>A long tap, with the finger held down.</li>
</ol>

<p>The output was displayed on the Arduino IDE's serial plotter and screenshots were taken of the results.</p>

<p>Each time an attempt was made to have the same length of long tap and the same tempo when tapping out the tune. However, in order to fit all the results onto a single screen of the serial plotter, the taps were speeded up slightly at the lower samples rates.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>There was a readable response at all sample rates, but the sensor code responded much slower at high sample rates. This can bee seen in the following sequence of graphs. Note that the X-axis represents the number of readings taken, <em>not</em> time. Consequently fact that the length of the test across the x axis reduces with incresing samples shows that there were less samples taken in a roughly fixed amount of time.</p>

<p>The various screen shots are displayed in the in incresing order of the number of samples in the carousel below.</p>
