<h1>Experiment #5: Comparison of different send pin resistances</h1>

<p>From research it seems that touch sensors become more sensitive the higher the resistance is between the send pin and the sensor. This experiment puts that to the test.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="./experiment-4.html">experiment #4</a>, only sensors number 3, 6 and 7 will be used from now on, along with the un-covered control sensor. To recap, the sensors&rsquo; coverings are:</p>

<ol>
    <li value="3">0.5mm thick white plastic card (used in modelling).</li>

    <li value="6">2 coats of artists acrylic paint over 2 coats of grey car primer.</li>

    <li value="7">46mm wide brown adhesive parcel tape.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>It was decided to compare each sensor&rsquo;s capacitance using three different resistances the sensor send pin and the sensor: 1M&ohm;, 2M&ohm; &amp; 3M&ohm;. Tests were repeated using 25 and 50 samples per reading.</p>

<p>Since the tests run in <a href="./experiment-4.html">experiment #4</a> used a 1M&ohm; resistor and included tests at the required sample rates, those results were re-used. New tests were run for all four sensors using 2M&ohm; and 3M&ohm; resistors at both 25 and 50 samples per reading. The new tests were identical in every way to experiment #4, except that the send pin resistance was changed.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The same code used in <a href="./experiment-4.html">experiment #4</a> was used, in the same way. This was <a href="https://github.com/cahamo/electro-tongue-drum/tree/main/src/research/GuidedSensorTouchDataLogger"><code>GuidedSensorTouchDataLogger</code></a>.</p>

<h2>Circuit</h2>

<p>The circuit used was identical to that used in <a href="./experiment-4.html">experiment #4</a>, except that the 1M&ohm; resistor was swapped for 2M&ohm; and then 3M&ohm; resistors. Since no 2M&ohm; or 3M&ohm; resistors were available, the test circuits used 2 or 3 1M&ohm; resistors in series.</p>

<p>The following diagram represents the circuit logically, showing the ability to switch between resistances.</p>

<p>However, this is not what was built. As has been mentioned, test results for the 1M&ohm; resistor were copied from experiment #4, and the circuit was altered to use either a 2M&ohm; or 3M&ohm; resistance as required. The following photo of the actual circuit used for the 3M&ohm; tests will suffice to illustrate:</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cahamo/electro-tongue-drum/tree/main/src/research/GuidedSensorTouchDataLogger"><code>GuidedSensorTouchDataLogger</code></a> was used once again.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The test data was once again recorded and analysed in a Libre Office Calc spreadsheet. The results were graphed. Copies of the graphs can be found in the following image carousels, each of which contains a graph for each sensor:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>As predicted by the research, each sensor got more sensitive the higher the resistance between the send pin and the sensor. The sensitivity appears to close to being linearly related to the ratio of the resistances in all cases. I.e. the size of the readings for the 2M&ohm; resistor is roughly double that for the 1M&ohm; resistor, while the size of readings for the 3M&ohm; resistor is approximately triple that for the 1M&ohm; resistor.</p>

<p>Purely from examining to graphs there would appear to be less variation in results when the sensor is touched for the higher resistance values. However no statistical analysis was performed.</p>

<p>The length of time needed to take a single reading seems to increase with resistance. This is more noticeable at 50 samples per reading than at 25 samples per reading. Consequently there may be a trade off to be made between resistance and speed.</p>
